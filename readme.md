# What is this?

This is a collection of thoughts based on my own experiences designing and maintaining databases.  I'm going to assume that you're already familiar with the Relational Model and understand how things like Foreign Key constraints work.  I'm also going to assume that you're using a database that has fully formed features like transactions and check constraints (seriously, if you're still using MySQL, you're doing yourself and your customers a serious disservice).

All examples are for PostgreSQL.  If you're using something else, you'll need to check with the documentation for comparable features.
